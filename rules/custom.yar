/*

This is the place to put handcrafted Yara rules.

HOWEVER

Please don't! Complex Yara rules cannot be converted
into grep patterns, and as such, the majority of people
(who use the grep signatures) will not be able to use
your pattern.

So only add rules here that cannot be expressed as a
single literal or regex.
